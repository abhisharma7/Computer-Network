Projects related to networking protocols and services

# Project 1: HTTP based Webserver

Using Socket Programming in Python, I have created a WebServer which can handle request from Browser as well as Terminal.


# Project 2: AI Socket

I have participated in HackDFW Hackathon 2016 and this socket program is just one module of the entire Project(AI Tele Services).

The purpose of this code is to act as a service on Amazon Aws Cloud Server, it accepts new connection parse it through Microsoft AI API and using Cisco Tropo API it will initiate a call to user.

Although we didn't win Hackathon but the project did receive appreciation @ Cisco Blog:
